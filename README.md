      i.	Example Program [Instruction Memory]
      ii.	Example Data [Data Memory]
  2.	Open Logisim.
  3.	Load the Single-Cycle Datapath Logisim File
    a.	File -> Open…
  4.	Load the Example Program and Example Data files into each memory unit:
    a.	Right click on Memory Unit -> Load image…
    b.	To add your own commands:
